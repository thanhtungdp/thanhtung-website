summary:
  - "Don't use expensive models for simple tasks. Model cost is just the tip — the real cost is the cost to produce a quality result."
  - "Five model groups, four work modes: creative, strategic, deep reasoning, large-scale repetitive."
  - "Upgrade rule: only move to a more expensive model when ambiguity, consequence of error, or autonomy requirements increase."
  - "Execution pattern: fast model handles bulk → balanced model handles hard cases → premium model or human reviews critical decisions."
keyTakeaway: "Don't find the best model. Design a system that knows which brain to use for which type of work."

## The real problem

If you use premium models for everything, you buy peace of mind with cost and latency. If you use cheap models for everything, you save tokens but pay with rework, bad decisions, and manual oversight.

## How to choose in 5 steps

1. **Clear or ambiguous task?** Clear output criteria → fast/cheap model. Ambiguous, needs reframing → strategic model.
2. **How expensive is one error?** Draft content can be fixed; pricing, legal, security decisions need strong models + review.
3. **Creative or consistent?** Creative work needs exploration space. Repetitive tasks need format, low temperature, eval.
4. **How much context?** Don't stuff everything into the prompt. Longer context needs more selection and staging.
5. **Tools and real actions?** Agents calling tools need format compliance, knowing when to stop, error recovery.

## Core principle

A model can do many things, but "can do" doesn't mean "should be assigned to". Choose by risk level, ambiguity, cost of error, and frequency.
